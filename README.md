Client for Music Player Daemon written in Rust (WIP)

# TODOs
- [ ] read config from a file (toml or yml?)
- [ ] make an own separate widget for displaying the queue table, because using one from tui-rs, creating and rendering it takes a lot of CPU usage
- [ ] try to use an alternative TUI to tui-rs
